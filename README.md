# MIDTERM-309
STA 309 Midterm Spring 2023 Jennifer Corke

The U.S. Department of Education's releases records regarding student proficiency in mathmatics as well as reading and language 
arts every year. This allows them to track student achievement in an attempt to compare the US education on a global scale, as well
as to ensure a national school system which is equal and fair. 

In an attempt to better understand this data, I took a look at the mathmatics as well as the reading and language arts 
proficiency records in the year 2020-2021. I was given flexibility for this project, and I chose to evaluate three different 
lenses in my dashboard for my statistics course.

In the first graph, I evaluated the Reading and Language Arts Proficiency in the US in 2020-2021 above or equal to 35. As you 
can see in the results of this map, the red represents the states which were above or equal to 35, whereas the lightblue indicates
states which were below. This is a rather interesting graph because there appears to be no real pattern when it comes to states 
which were above or below the score of 35. Something I found interesting was that Illinois was below 35. When I think about this,
being from Illinois, there is a lot of unequal education institutions in this state, especially in the city of Chicago, which 
could explain this.

Moving forward, I made a box-plot comparing Michigan vs Ohio Reading and Language Arts Proficiency Score in 2020-2021. When looking
at this graph, it is interesting to see that the record scores for Michigan vs Ohio are NEARLY the same number, just off by a sheer 
decimal. This made me wonder what the maps of the counties between each of these states would look like in relation to educational records, 
which I think would be interesting to look at someday further.

Finally, I took a look at the Math Proficiency in the US in 2020-2021 above or equal to 35, where once more, the red represents states above 35,
and the light blue represents states below. Now, in comparison to the reading and language arts map I made above, this plot differs immensely.
There are many more states which had a record in math proficiency below 35. This makes sense as it seems to be common knowledge that many students 
tend to struggle more or fear the subject of mathematics, which would cause scores to be lower. I found it interesting that lower scores were in 
the south as well as on the west coast, with a few outliers. This would be something interesting to further explore. 



After diving deeper and evaluating the US department of Education's mathematics and/or reading proficiency scores for 2020-2021, I found some
interesting comparisons from a state level between the records for the RLA and mathematics. Further, I took a deeper look in between two states,
Michigan and Ohio, which showed me that the RLA scores between these two Midwestern states were shockingly similar. 
From this assignment, I learned how to create a dashboard in order to meaningfully display my data for others to see, which is a skill I know
will take me far in my future.
